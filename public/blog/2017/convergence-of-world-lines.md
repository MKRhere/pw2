snippet: In an infinite number of universes where anything is possible, I want to meet you again in all of them, and fall in love with you all over again.
---

Iâ€™ve been watching Steins;Gate over the last week and Iâ€™ve been completely blown away by the sheer amount of work gone into this series. When it ended. it left me speechless and sad because I missed being part of the universe of Okabe Rintarou (Hououin Kyouma) and his lab. I learnt that a sequel is in the making and the visual novel Steins;Gate 0 is already outâ€¦ But in the mean time, I needed to let some feelings out.

> No matter how many times I have to watch [death] to save you, itâ€™s not going to break me!

> â€“ Okabe Rintarou

Okabe repeatedly travels to the past, each time to watch someone close to him die, and fervently keeps trying despite the mental trauma he experiences. This line affected me the hardest, because it reminded me of something I told someone, a long time ago.

> In an infinite number of universes where anything is possible, I want to meet you again in all of them, and fall in love with you all over again.

And again, when recollecting to someone else:

> If I knew what was going to happen, and how we would separate, I wouldnâ€™t change a thing about it. I would go back in time and watch us fall in love, and watch her break apart, without a moment of regret.

Itâ€™s funny how world lines converge to form a consistent story-line, some times even from a fictional world. We relate to fictional characters, a piece of someone elseâ€™s imagination, and we live them with our livesâ€¦ Well then, who is to say they arenâ€™t real?

I realize itâ€™s December 14th, 4:00 AM as I write this. today, 3 years ago, the event that will separate us will happen. After all this time, I havenâ€™t changed. I hoped I would, and I tried. I thought I moved on, but I am emotionally and mentally bound to the past. I do not think that I want us back together. If she is happy elsewhere, then thatâ€™s the reality I want to see. Iâ€™m simply in love with a woman in the past. Itâ€™s sad, but itâ€™s what makes me me. All the events that happened in the past 22 years are part of the threads that form the continuum that is me.

Okabe reached the Steins;Gate world lineâ€¦ Maybe this is my Steins;Gate world line, and this is the best outcome. Maybe our souls passed by and are fated to never meet againâ€”
