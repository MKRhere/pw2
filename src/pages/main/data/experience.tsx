				<p>
					The Feathers was a creative collective, comprising mostly of students
					and amateur artists and entertainers pursuing various creative
					endeavours.
				</p>
				<p>
					This varied from photography, typography, graphic design, short films,
					music, to ad films and event coverage.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was an early attempt at creating something out of pure passion, and
					gave rise to such projects as StudioFlicks, OutFocus, and the like.
				</p>
				<p>
					It gives me immense pride and joy to see former members go on to build
					amazing careers and pursue interests.
